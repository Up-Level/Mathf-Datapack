# Mathf-Datapack

This is a datapack for other datapack developers, featuring many well-documented mathematical functions. It is also [IMP-Compliant](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec), meaning it will not have incompatibilities with other datapacks.

This is still under development and several functions are still just copy-pasted from the KitPvP datapack I'm working on, so not everything is well documented (yet).
More functions will be added in the future.
