# Mathf-Datapack

This is a datapack for other datapack developers, featuring many well-documented mathematical functions. It is also [IMP-Compliant](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec), meaning it will not have incompatibilities with other datapacks.

Enter input values i0, i1, i2 etc. into the `mathf.io` scoreboard. Output values are given by o0, o1, o2 etc. also in the `mathf.io` scoreboard.
Input values are often not preserved (don't expect input values to be the same as entered after running a function.)

This is still under development and several functions are still just copy-pasted from the KitPvP datapack I'm working on, so not everything is well documented (yet).
More functions will be added in the future.
